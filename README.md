# Metaheuristics-Template-Library
Metaheuristics Template Library / supported Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Neural Network. 

waring: It is under development.

##Overview
MTL is a header-only library for meta-heuristics programming.

When you wanted to use the meta-heuristics, or when you need abstract and highly reusable architecture than, this library would be useful always.

## Description
support the following algorithm

1.Genetic Algorithm

2.Simulated Annealing

3.Neural Network

This framework is a static implementation, and works faster than usual. Instead, the compilation will take some time.

Anyone who is able to use moddern C++, would can handle this easily.

## Requirement
C++14 Compiler

OpenCV 2.49 (TSP of GA/SA sample)

## Install
 Please place the file of purpose in the same directory, and compile.
 
 compile option: `-std=c++1y`
