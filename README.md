# Metaheuristics-Library
Metaheuristics Template Library / supported Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Neural Network. 

##Overview
C++ Metaheuristics Template Library

When you wanted to use the meta-heuristics , or when you need abstract and highly reusable architecture than, this library would be useful always .

## Description
support the following algorithm

1.Genetic Algorithm

2.Simulated Annealing

3.Neural Network

This framework is a static implementation, and works faster than usual. Instead, the compilation will take some time.

Anyone who is able to use moddern C++, would can handle this easily.

## Requirement
C++11

OpenCV 2.49 (TSP of GA/SA sample)

## Install
 Place the file of purpose in the same directory , and please compile .
 
 compile option: `-std=c++1y`
